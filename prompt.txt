This is my desire project.
My overall project is about doing a people crowd analysis. It's about if i organize some event about booth event in some area and i want to analyse people crowd. How about people walk path? How about crowd density on map with time series, counting people in/out realtime, etc.

this my resource
-1 computer (rtx 3080ti, i5-12400f, ram32gb, storage 512gb)

what's about my requirements.

1.Assume i organize some booth event on some area. i have plan image of that floor area of the building, and CCTV that capture the all door of the building, and capture the event area cover all the booth.

2.I want to do 2 tasks. 

2.1 First is real-time task. It's counting people enter and exit the booth event using CCTV that capture the door of that building, and record the CCTV that capture event area to video.
For specific, if I have 5 camera that capture the door area. i want to use small AI model(that take short time inference) to detect human and count them. and i want this part to be the most possible close to realtime(i want to optimize this part). And if there 3 of them(CCTV) that capture the event area I want to record them to video using stream frame from CCTV by parallel(I want to optimize this part) to video that long as the event is finish(Would it be the storage problem?). So this real-time task will have 2 subprocess.
conclusion:
-deal with multi CCTV
-counting people for each CCTV using AI
-record video from stream data from CCTV


2.2 second is not real-time task. It's about process the video from capture the booth event area. by process every video using accurate AL and do tracking to get the prediction every frame and then store the result. So i could use this result to map them on the real floor plan, and do some analyse. For example watch crowd density of real plan by time series, Make a ROI each booth to watch the what people interested in?.
conclusion:
-Process Video from recording CCTV
-Predict people position and tracking
-Map camera to real plan. And do some analyse

what do you think my is robust? is my idea good?

I would like to start with real-time task about camera. 
I want you to design me a module of camera section for initialization. 
I want a class of camera and the have 2 subclasses to handle source from "CCTV", and "Video". 
Then i farther can use to inference module, recording module, and process video module. What do you think, is it good idea?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Let's move to AI model part. I want you to design me a abstract class of AI model. The main model type is a human detection and tracking. Farther, I can use to inference one input data or batch data, and can choose device to process model(cpu, gpu), can optimize model like half, last_channel, make to TensorRT, etc.
And right now, I want a subclasses of yolov8 model human detection. What do you think, is it good idea?

for creation requirements
-I want user to create rectangle, create 4 points and random 1 color for that roi. By use will hold click. Start coordinate from mouse position on self._map_image is the first point
-While holding mouse and drag cursor, coordinate from current mouse position is the last (fourth) point.
And remain 2 two points will be second and third point. 
And show text as "n" order point near each points position.
And fill rectangle with color with 0.5 alpha value. 
And show roi_name "area_n" (n is roi order) as name of roi in the center of that rectangle.
And if user press "r" while holding action, it will cancel of that roi creation
(while this holding mouse action user will cannot to quit with pressing "q".)
-if user release mouse click. That roi will add to roi_data_temp.
-if user click again mean they want to create second roi, then do the same step.
-if user mouse cursor over the exist roi area, and press r. it will remove that roi.
-if user press "s". it will save to json file.
-I want to collect self._roi as dictionary following this structure:
# name of roi and point order is auto increment
{
   area_1:
   {
   1 : 1st point,,
   2 : 2nd point,
   3 : 3rd point,
   4 : 4th point,
   },
   area_2:
   {
   1 : 1st point,,
   2 : 2nd point,
   3 : 3rd point,
   4 : 4th point,
   }
}


for editing requirements
-if user hold click their mouse cursor near over the exist point of any roi if they can move it position and release click to stop moving point
-if user hold click their mouse cursor near over the the center of any roi if they can move that whole roi and release click to stop moving point
-if user mouse cursor over the exist roi area, and press r. it will remove that roi.
-if there are any the following action, data will be changed in roi_data_temp.
-if user press "s". it will save to json file.

if there are some weak logic in my design logic, you can change properly.
